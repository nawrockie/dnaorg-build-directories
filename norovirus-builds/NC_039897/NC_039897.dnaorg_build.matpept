# This file explains how CDS and mat_peptide annotation for NC_039897 are related
#
# Format of lines in this file:
#<CDS-idx> <'primary' OR 'all'> <mat_peptide-1-idx>:<mat_peptide-2-idx>:<mat_peptide-n-idx>
#
# 'primary' lines: these define the 'primary' peptides in order, the CDS <CDS-idx> is comprised
#                  of the peptides listed in final token, which are contiguous, start of first
#                  mat_peptide to stop of final mat_peptide is one contiguous subsequence.
# 'all' lines:     these define all the peptides that are ultimately derived from CDS <CDS-idx>.
#                  It will be a superset of the primary line for this index but will additionally
#                  include mat_peptides that are secondarily cleaved from the primary mat_peptides.
